                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>vMOX was entering the mobile helpdesk space in the spring of 2020.  
                        We had identified strong client interest in both our current client base as an upsell opportunity and new fully qualified leads. 
                        The organization is extremly lean and planned to bring on two dedicated helpdesk agents to keep our customer's demands.  
                        For the offering to work, we had to build a solution that enabled minimal handling times, reduced call volume, and improved caller satisfaction. 
                    
                        I owned the solutioning process of ideation to release.  We trialed numerous platforms to meet our business needs.  Since the organization is hosted in AWS
                        the fit made logical sense as we could leverage our existing infrastructure and microservices to achieve success. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AWS provided most of the heavy lifting for us.  We had to figure out how to get data known within our database into the AWS Connect client that would reside in our internal application. 
                        The goal here was to collect as much information as possible about the caller and present that back to our helpdesk agents before they picked up the phone to help our customer end user. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deploy AWS connect as contact center solution.</li>	
                        <li>Integrate Lambda functions for dynamic call flows.</li>	
                        <li>Set up metric reporting and visibility. This is contained within AWS.</li>	
                        <li>Assign agents to each queue allowing failover between queue.  Ensure documentation is updated during onboarding.</li>  	
                        <li>Present all identifiable information to agent prior to call presentment. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Project Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        I owned the project success which included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Initial customer interviews</li>
                            <li>Requirement gathering</li>
                            <li>Requirement documentation</li>
                            <li>Developer hand off</li>
                            <li>QA sign off</li>
                            <li>End user training</li>
                            <li>Product release</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>During requirement gathering, we identified numerous areas of the project that would be nice to have but were not critical to the success of the project implementation</p>
                    <p>Each of these ideas were documented and implemented as separate enhancements after the initial go live.  I dive into the iterative approach at end of this page.</p>

                            <p>Our primary stakeholder was our procurement manager who was leading the key initiative. During our interviews with this key stakeholder, ownership of the process flow was defined. 
                                This process flow would become the basis to drive the remainder of our product requirements.

                            The call routing profile within AWS Connect took the most planning to complete. 
                            Every aspect of the user experience had to reviewed and tested to ensure we didn't drop a caller into an IVR loop without an opportunity to speak with a real person.
